# USBFileHarvester
This PowerShell script scans all local drives for files with a specified extension (e.g., .txt), copies them to a temporary folder, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and saves the archive to a USB drive labeled by the user. It is designed for ethical use in data collection, audits, backups, or forensic training environments.

      USBFileHarvester Script - Instructions
===================================================

üìå Purpose:
This script searches all local drives for files with a specific extension 
(e.g., *.txt), copies them to a temporary folder, compresses them into a ZIP file, 
and saves the ZIP to your USB drive.

---------------------------------------------------
üîß Setup Steps:
---------------------------------------------------
1. CHOOSE A LABEL FOR YOUR USB DRIVE:
   - Your USB can be labeled anything you want (e.g., DUCKYDRIVE, TOOLKIT, SECUREUSB).
   - To label the drive:
     - Open File Explorer
     - Right-click your USB drive
     - Click "Properties"
     - Set the "Label" to your desired name (e.g., MYUSB), then click OK

2. EDIT THE PowerShell SCRIPT:
   - Open `CollectFiles.ps1` in Notepad
   - Find this line:
       `$usbLabel = "DUCKYDRIVE"`
   - Change "DUCKYDRIVE" to the **label you gave your USB drive**
     (e.g., "MYUSB", "SECUREUSB", etc.)

   - OPTIONAL: To target a different file type, edit this line:
       `$targetExtension = "*.txt"`
     Replace `.txt` with `.jpg`, `.docx`, etc.

3. PLACE THESE FILES ON THE ROOT OF YOUR USB:
   - `CollectFiles.ps1`       ‚Üê The main PowerShell script
   - `launcher.vbs`           ‚Üê (Optional) Runs the PowerShell script silently
   - `Instructions.txt`       ‚Üê (This file)

---------------------------------------------------
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Script:
---------------------------------------------------
üîπ Option 1: Visible Method (PowerShell)
   - Double-click `CollectFiles.ps1`
   - This opens a PowerShell window showing progress

üîπ Option 2: Stealth Mode (VBS Launcher)

   - This runs the script **silently** (no window)
   - You'll get a small popup once the ZIP file is saved

---------------------------------------------------
üìÅ What Happens:
---------------------------------------------------
- The script searches all local drives (C:\, D:\, etc.) for files matching your chosen extension
- Matching files are copied to a temporary folder
- The collected files are zipped and saved to your USB as:
    `CollectedFiles.zip`
- The temporary folder is deleted automatically after completion
