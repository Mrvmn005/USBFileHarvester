# USBFileHarvester
This PowerShell script scans all local drives for files with a specified extension (e.g., .txt), copies them to a temporary folder, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and saves the archive to a USB drive labeled by the user. It is designed for ethical use in data collection, audits, backups, or forensic training environments.
